    "This practical class will:\n",
    "* introduce you to binaural cues for sound localization -- Interaural Level Difference (ILD) and Interaural Time Difference (ITD)\n",
    "* enable you to measure your own sensitivity to ILD and ITD, and use this to determine when these cues are useful\n",
    "* evaluate Rayleigh's duplex theory of sound localization\n",
    "\n",
    "Binaural cues are differences in the sounds reaching the two ears which occur due to the position of the sound source. By analysing these cues, your brain is able to estimate the spatial location from which the sound came. The most common binaural cues are ILD and ITD. ILD is the difference in sound level that results from the \"acoustic shadow\" caused by your head blocking the direct path of sounds to your ears. ITD is the time difference that results from sounds having to travel further to one ear than the other. Our brains uses a combination of these cues to determine the location of sound sources, but which cue is more useful depends on the characteristics of each sound.\n",

Fitting curves like this is a good way of estimating the underlying psychometric function (i.e. the function that describes your sensitivity to changes in a particular sensory parameter) from the data sample we obtained.\n",

    "**Q1: On the psychometric functions you obtained, which ILD values are associated with 50% right responses? Which ILD value would you expect to be associated with 50% right?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Psychometric curves are useful for determining how sensitive you are to ILDs. The steeper the slope of the sigmoid, the smaller the change in ILD required to produce a noticeable difference in your judgments. However, people rarely report sensory performance as slope values (%right/ dB). Instead, they tend to report \"thresholds\". The ILD threshold can be defined as the change in ILD that is just large enough to raise the %right judgments from 50% (completely random guessing) to a reasonable level of performance (often 75%).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2: Using a performance threshold of 75%, what is your ILD threshold for each of the two frequencies tested?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The thresholds obtained for the two frequencies may be very similar or somewhat different. To decide whether there is a real physiological difference between them, we first have to show whether any observed difference in thresholds is statistically significant or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do that would require a suitable statistical test, for example some type of \"bootstrap\". The statistical techniques needed to analyze these data properly are beyond the scope of this practical. However, you may be able to gain some intuition about this if you think about the problem in the following manner: Your \"true\" psychometric function will specify for each particular ILD, the probability that you will report the sound as coming from the right. The experiment cannot measure this probability directly, only estimate it from the frequency of actual right responses in a quite limited number of trials (here about 10 for each ILD tested). Let's say the true underlying probability for a particular ILD was 75%. Testing that ILD would then be a bit like flipping a biased coin that has a probability of landing \"heads\" on 75% of trials. Would it be impossible for such a biased coin to produce, say, only 50% heads in a short run of only 10 trials? If you think this through, you will probably appreciate that the % right scores observed in this very short experiment are only very rough estimates of your true psychometric function.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may also have wondered what the thick broken curves on the plots represent. These are 95% confidence intervals for the psychometric functions fitted to your data. The algorithm that fitted the sigmoids is clever enough to appreciate that the sigmoid it produced is only an estimate, and that the true underlying function could be fairly different from that \"best estimate\". So when you compare the data obtained at the two different frequencies, you could ask yourself, would it be unreasonable to suspect that the data points in the top graph come from the confidence interval plotted in the lower graph, or vice versa?\n",

    "You should by now have obtained estimates of your own ILD sensitivity at 500 and 2,000 Hz. Your ILD thresholds in dB may or may not have been very similar for the two frequencies. However, ILDs are a cue to sound source direction. Source directions are not specified in dB! To localize sounds in space, your brain needs to translate ILD values to angles in the horizontal plane (also known as azimuth). To see how useful a particular ILD would be, say, for detecting a change in sound source direction away from \"straight ahead\" (zero degrees azimuth), we need to know what ILD values are normally associated with different sound source directions for different sound frequencies. The graph below shows ILDs measured as a function of sound source direction measured in an adult male with small microphones inserted in the ear canal. ILD values are plotted for a number of frequencies and sound source directions (azimuthal angles).\n",
