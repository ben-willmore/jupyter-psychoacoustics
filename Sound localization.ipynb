    "This practical class will:\n",
    "* introduce you to binaural cues for sound localization -- Interaural Level Difference (ILD) and Interaural Time Difference (ITD)\n",
    "* enable you to measure your own sensitivity to ILD and ITD, and use this to determine when these cues are useful\n",
    "* evaluate Rayleigh's duplex theory of sound localization\n",
    "\n",
    "Binaural cues are differences in the sounds reaching the two ears which occur due to the position of the sound source. By analysing these cues, your brain is able to estimate the spatial location that the sound came from. The most common binaural cues are ILD and ITD. ILD is the difference in sound level that results from the \"acoustic shadow\" caused by your head blocking the direct path of sounds to your ears. ITD is the time difference that results from sounds having to travel further to one ear than the other. Our brains uses a combination of these cues to determine the location of sound sources, but which cue is more useful depends on the characteristics of each sound.\n",

    "\n",
    "The symbols show how often you clicked \"right\" for the ILD value given on the x-axis. The continuous line is a \"cumulative Gaussian\" sigmoidal curve fitted to your data by the software. Fitting curves like this is a good way of estimating the underlying psychometric function (i.e. the function that describes your sensitivity to changes in a particular sensory parameter) from the data sample we obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question: On the psychometric functions you obtained, which ILD values are associated with 50% right responses? Which ILD value would you expect to be associated with 50% right?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Psychometric curves are useful for determining how sensitive you are to ILDs. The steeper the slope of the sigmoid, the smaller the change in ILD required to produce a \"noticeable\" difference in your % right judgments. However, people rarely report sensory performance as slope values (%right/ dB). Instead, they tend to report \"thresholds\", i.e. changes in ILD which are just large enough to raise the %right judgments from 50% (completely random guessing) to some \"threshold performance level\". \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question: Choose a threshold level (75% correct might be a good choice) and determine the corresponding ILD threshold for the two frequencies tested. Make a note of these ILD thresholds.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The thresholds obtained for the two frequencies may be very similar, or somewhat different. Do you have a feeling for whether they are \"meaningfully different\"? There are really two aspects to this question: 1) is the difference \"substantial\" (physiologically significant, and 2) do you think it might be statistically significant? For the first part you will need to use your judgment - there is no generally accepted way of deciding how big is big. But if the difference is not statistically significant, then any observed difference in thresholds for the two frequencies may not be real.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to answer the second part of this question rigorously would require a suitable statistical test, for example some type of \"bootstrap\". The statistical techniques needed to do this properly are somewhat beyond the scope of this practical. However, you may be able to gain some intuition about this if you think about the problem in the following manner: Your \"true\" psychometric function will specify: for each particular ILD, the probability that you will report the sound as coming from the right. The experiment cannot measure this probability directly, only estimate it from the frequency of actual right responses in a quite limited number of trials (here about 8 for each ILD tested). Let's say the true underlying probability for a particular ILD was 75%. Testing that ILD would then be a bit like flipping a biassed coin that has a probability of landing \"heads\" on 75% of trials. Would it be impossible for such a biased coin to produce, say, only 50% heads in a short run of only 8 trials? If you think this through you will probably appreciate that the % right scores observed in this very short experiment are only very rough estimates of your true psychometric function. You may also have wodered what the think broken curves on teh plots represent. These are 95% confidence intervals for the psychometric functions fitted to your data. The algorithm that fitted the sigmoids is clever enough to appreciate that the sigmoid it produced is only an estimate, and that the true underrlying function could be fairly different from that \"best estimate\". So when you compare the data obtained at the two different frequencies, you could ask yourself, would it be unreasonable to suspect that the data points in the top graph come from the confidence interval plotted in the lower graph, or vice-versa?\n",

    "You should by now have obtained estimates of your own ILD sensitivity at 500 and 2,000 Hz!. Your ILD thresholds in dB may or may not have been very similar for the two frequencies. However, ILDs are a cue to sound source direction. Source directions are not specified in dB! To localize sounds in space, your brain needs to \"translate\" ILD values to angles relative to the inter-aural axis. To see how useful a particular ILD would be, say, for detecting a change in sound source direction away from \"straight ahead\" (zero degrees azimuth) we need to know what ILD values are normally associated with different sound source directions for different sound frequencies. The graph below shows ILDs measured as a function of sound source direction measured in an adult male with small microphones inserted in the ear canal. ILD values are plotted for a number of frequencies and sound source directions (azimuthal angles).\n",
